In programming, **structures** (`struct`) and **classes** (`class`) are used to define custom data types, but they differ in behavior, features, and usage depending on the language. Below is a general comparison between structures and classes, primarily in **C++** contexts:

### **C++: Structure vs Class**

1. **Default Access Specifier**:
   - **Struct**: Members are public by default.
   - **Class**: Members are private by default.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - **Struct**: Can inherit from other structs or classes, but the default inheritance mode is public.
   - **Class**: Can inherit from other classes or structs, but the default inheritance mode is private.

3. **Use Case**:
   - **Struct**: Typically used for simpler data types, such as PODs (Plain Old Data).
   - **Class**: Used for complex types that include behavior (methods) along with data.

4. **Features**:
   - Both support constructors, destructors, member functions, and access specifiers.
   - Structs in C++ are nearly identical to classes apart from default access and inheritance mode.
