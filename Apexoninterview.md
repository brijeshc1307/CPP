Sure! Here are **sample Apexon interview questions and answers**, grouped by category and tailored for **software engineering roles** (but relevant across many tech positions).

---

## ðŸ”¹ **1. Technical Fundamentals (SDLC, OOP, etc.)**

**Q1. Explain the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).**
**A:**
The SDLC is a structured process used to develop software efficiently and with quality. The main stages include:

1. **Requirement Gathering**
2. **System Design**
3. **Implementation / Coding**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**
   It helps in managing the project effectively, reducing errors, and ensuring timely delivery.

---

**Q2. What are the four principles of OOP?**
**A:**

1. **Encapsulation** â€“ Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
2. **Inheritance** â€“ Deriving new classes from existing ones.
3. **Polymorphism** â€“ Ability to take many forms, like method overloading or overriding.
4. **Abstraction** â€“ Hiding internal implementation details and showing only necessary features.

## ðŸ”¹ **2. Coding / DSA**

**Q3. Write a function to perform binary search in a sorted array.**
**A (Python):**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

---

**Q4. Decode a string like "2\[a]3\[bc]" â†’ "aabcbcbc"**
**A (Python):**

```python
def decode_string(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char != ']':
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            substr = ''
            while stack[-1] != '[':
                substr = stack.pop() + substr
            stack.pop()  # Remove '['
            num = ''
            while stack and stack[-1].isdigit():
                num = stack.pop() + num
            stack.append(int(num) * substr)
    return ''.join(stack)
```

## ðŸ”¹ **3. System / DevOps / Tools**

**Q5. What is SonarQube, and how is it used in CI/CD?**
**A:**
SonarQube is a code quality tool that scans code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. In CI/CD, itâ€™s integrated into the pipeline (e.g., Jenkins or Azure DevOps) to automatically analyze code on each commit or pull request. This helps maintain high code quality and avoid technical debt.

---

**Q6. How does a HashMap work internally?**
**A:**
A HashMap uses a hash function to compute an index based on a key. The key-value pair is stored at that index in an array.

* If two keys have the same hash (collision), it uses chaining (linked lists or trees in Java) to handle it.
* Retrieval is O(1) on average, but could be O(n) in worst-case if many collisions occur.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **4. SQL & Data Handling**

**Q7. Write a query to find the third-highest salary from an Employee table.**
**A (SQL):**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ **5. JavaScript / React (if applicable)**

**Q8. What are some drawbacks of React Native?**
**A:**

* Performance lags compared to native apps for complex UI or heavy computation
* Limited access to some native modules or APIs
* Requires frequent updates with React and native dependencies
* Sometimes debugging is harder than in native development

---

## ðŸ”¹ **6. Behavioral / HR Round**

**Q9. Tell me about a challenging project and how you handled it.**
**A:**
In my last project, we had to migrate a monolithic system to microservices within a tight deadline. The challenge was managing inter-service communication and data consistency. I proposed a phased migration plan using API gateways and message queues for async processing. We completed it ahead of schedule and reduced system downtime by 40%.

---

**Q10. Why do you want to join Apexon?**
**A:**
Iâ€™m impressed by Apexonâ€™s focus on digital transformation and its work in healthcare and finance domains. I value innovation and working with forward-thinking teams, and Apexon's tech stack aligns well with my experience. Iâ€™m excited to contribute to meaningful projects that impact real users.

Sure! Here's a focused list of **C++ interview questions and answers**, specifically tailored for an **Apexon C++ role**. These include both conceptual and coding questions based on common interview themes.

---

## âœ… **C++ Interview Questions & Answers**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. What is the difference between `new/delete` and `malloc/free`?**

**Answer:**

* `new/delete` are C++ operators that:

  * Call constructors/destructors.
  * Perform type safety.
* `malloc/free` are C functions that:

  * Only allocate/deallocate memory.
  * Do **not** call constructors or destructors.

**Example:**

```cpp
MyClass* obj = new MyClass();  // constructor called
delete obj;                    // destructor called

MyClass* obj2 = (MyClass*)malloc(sizeof(MyClass)); // no constructor
free(obj2);                                          // no destructor
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. What is a virtual function and why do we need a virtual destructor?**

**Answer:**

* A **virtual function** allows **runtime polymorphism** (deciding which function to call based on object type).
* A **virtual destructor** ensures that when a derived object is deleted via a base class pointer, the **derived destructor is called**.

**Example:**

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() { std::cout << "Base destructor\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { std::cout << "Derived destructor\n"; }
};

Base* obj = new Derived();
delete obj;  // Without virtual ~Base(), only Base destructor is called
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Explain `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`.**

**Answer:**

* `unique_ptr`: Owns an object exclusively. Cannot be copied.
* `shared_ptr`: Allows multiple pointers to share ownership. Uses reference counting.
* `weak_ptr`: Observes a `shared_ptr` without affecting its lifetime. Prevents circular references.

**Example:**

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<int> uptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);
std::shared_ptr<int> sptr1 = std::make_shared<int>(20);
std::weak_ptr<int> wptr = sptr1;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. What is RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)?**

**Answer:**
RAII is a C++ technique where **resources are tied to object lifetime**. The resource is acquired in the constructor and released in the destructor.

**Example:**

```cpp
class FileHandler {
    std::fstream file;
public:
    FileHandler(const std::string& filename) {
        file.open(filename);
    }
    ~FileHandler() {
        file.close();  // Automatically called when object goes out of scope
    }
};
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. What is the difference between `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`?**

**Answer:**

| Feature        | `std::map`     | `std::unordered_map`          |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Implementation | Red-black tree | Hash table                    |
| Order          | Sorted by keys | No guaranteed order           |
| Lookup time    | O(logâ€¯n)       | O(1) average, O(n) worst case |
| Use Case       | Ordered data   | Fast lookups, unordered data  |

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Write a C++ function to check if a string is a palindrome.**

**Answer:**

```cpp
bool isPalindrome(const std::string& str) {
    int left = 0, right = str.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (str[left++] != str[right--])
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. Explain the Rule of Three / Five / Zero in C++.**

**Answer:**

* **Rule of Three**: If a class needs a **custom destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment**, it likely needs all three.
* **Rule of Five** (C++11+): Adds **move constructor and move assignment**.
* **Rule of Zero**: Best practice in modern C++ â€” use STL and smart pointers so you donâ€™t need any of the five special functions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **8. What is the use of `const` in C++?**

**Answer:**

* Prevents modification:

  * `const int a = 5;`
* Can be used for:

  * **Const member functions** â†’ cannot modify class state.
  * **Const references/pointers** â†’ prevents reassignment/modification.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void show() const {
        // Cannot modify any member variables here
    }
};
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **9. What are the advantages of using C++ over C in large projects?**

**Answer:**

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* RAII & better memory safety with smart pointers
* STL for efficient containers & algorithms
* Better abstraction and modularity
* Operator overloading, templates, etc.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **10. What happens if you donâ€™t have a virtual destructor in a base class?**

**Answer:**
Deleting a derived object through a base pointer **without** a virtual destructor causes **undefined behavior**. Usually, only the base destructor is called, which may **leak resources**.
