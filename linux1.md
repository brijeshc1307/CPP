### 4. **What are runlevels in Linux?**

**Answer:**
Runlevels define the state of a Linux system:

* **0** – Halt
* **1** – Single-user mode (maintenance)
* **2** – Multi-user without network (Debian-based)
* **3** – Multi-user with networking (text mode)
* **4** – Undefined / Custom
* **5** – Multi-user with GUI (graphical mode)
* **6** – Reboot

Modern systems use **systemd targets** instead of runlevels.

* **ksh** (Korn Shell)

Most systems use **bash** as the default shell due to its scripting capabilities and wide adoption.

---

### 8. **What is a process and how do you manage it in Linux?**

**Answer:**
A process is an instance of a running program. You can manage processes using:

* `ps` – View running processes.
* `top` or `htop` – Monitor processes interactively.
* `kill <PID>` – Terminate a process.
* `nice` / `renice` – Set process priority.
* `&`, `fg`, `bg`, `jobs` – Manage background/foreground jobs.

---

### 9. **What is the use of the `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, and `mkdir` commands?**

**Answer:**

* `ls` – Lists files and directories.
* `cd` – Changes the current directory.
* `pwd` – Prints the current directory path.
* `mkdir` – Creates a new directory.

sudo lsof -i :<port_number>
```

or

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep <port_number>
```

or (modern replacement for netstat):

```bash
sudo ss -tulnp | grep <port_number>
```

This shows the process ID (PID) and the application using that port.

---

### 2. **How do you check disk usage in Linux?**

**Answer:**

* To check the usage of mounted filesystems:

```bash
df -h
```

* To check disk usage of directories/files:

```bash
du -sh /path/to/directory
```

* To get a full usage report:

```bash
du -h --max-depth=1 /
```

---

### 3. **What is the purpose of the `/etc/fstab` file?**

**Answer:**
`/etc/fstab` is used to define how disk partitions, storage devices, or remote filesystems should be mounted during boot. It includes details like the device, mount point, filesystem type, options, and dump/pass values.

**Example entry:**

```
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /data  ext4  defaults  0  2
```

---

### 4. **How do you view and kill running processes?**

**Answer:**

* View processes:

```bash
ps aux           # All running processes
top              # Real-time monitoring
htop             # Interactive (if installed)
```

* Kill process:

```bash
kill <PID>       # Graceful termination
kill -9 <PID>    # Force kill
```

Find and kill by name:

```bash
pkill process_name
```

---

### 5. **How do you find files in Linux using `find` and `locate`?**

**Answer:**

* Using `find` (real-time search):

```bash
find /path -name "filename.txt"
find / -type f -size +100M
```

* Using `locate` (faster, uses indexed DB):

```bash
locate filename.txt
```

Update the `locate` DB:

```bash
sudo updatedb
```

| Cross filesystem | Not allowed                  | Allowed                       |
| Directory links  | Not allowed                  | Allowed                       |

**Commands:**

```bash
ln original.txt hardlink.txt      # Hard link
ln -s original.txt symlink.txt    # Soft link
```

---

### 7. **How do permissions work in Linux? What do `rwx` mean?**

**Answer:**

* `r` – Read (4)
* `w` – Write (2)
* `x` – Execute (1)

Permission format (e.g., `-rwxr-xr--`):

* First char: file type (`-` for file, `d` for directory)
* Next 3: owner permissions
* Next 3: group permissions
* Last 3: others

Example:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh   # rwxr-xr-x
```

---

### 8. **Explain `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.**

**Answer:**

* `chmod`: Change file permissions

  ```bash
  chmod 755 file.txt
  chmod u+x script.sh
  ```

### 9. **What is the difference between `cron` and `at`?**

| Feature    | `cron`                      | `at`           |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Scheduling | Repeated tasks (e.g. daily) | One-time task  |
| Syntax     | Uses crontab (cron table)   | Direct command |
| Daemon     | `crond`                     | `atd`          |

**Examples:**

* `cron`:

```bash
crontab -e
# Run every day at 5PM
0 17 * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

* `at`:

```bash
echo "/path/to/script.sh" | at 17:00
```

---

### 10. **What is a zombie process?**

**Answer:**
A **zombie process** is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table. It happens when the parent process doesn't call `wait()` to read the exit status.

You can identify zombies using:

```bash
ps aux | grep 'Z'
```

They usually appear like:

```
defunct
```

Zombies do not consume CPU or memory (just a slot in the process table).

Sure! Here's a complete and clear set of answers to the **Advanced Linux Interview Questions** from earlier.

---

## 🔷 Advanced Linux Interview Questions – With Answers

---

### 1. **Explain how the Linux boot process works (BIOS → GRUB → Kernel → init).**

**Answer:**

The Linux boot process involves several stages:

1. **BIOS / UEFI**

   * Initializes hardware.
   * Loads the **bootloader** from the MBR or EFI partition.

2. **GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)**

   * Displays boot menu.
   * Loads the selected **kernel** and **initrd** (initial RAM disk).

3. **Kernel**

   * Initializes hardware drivers and mounts the root filesystem.
   * Starts the first process: **`init`** or **`systemd`**.

4. **init / systemd**

   * `systemd` (modern init system) initializes all system services and targets.
   * Starts all required daemons and brings the system to a usable state (e.g., multi-user, GUI, etc.).

---

### 2. **What is LVM and how does it work?**

**Answer:**
**LVM (Logical Volume Manager)** allows flexible disk management.

* You can **resize** volumes without unmounting.
* Combine multiple physical drives into one logical volume.

**Key components:**

* **PV (Physical Volume):** Actual disks or partitions.
* **VG (Volume Group):** Pool of PVs.
* **LV (Logical Volume):** Resizable partitions from the VG.

**Example flow:**

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb
vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb
lvcreate -L 10G -n mylv myvg
mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv
mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt/data
```

---

### 3. **How do you troubleshoot a system that won’t boot?**

**Answer:**

**Steps:**

1. **Check boot errors** – Look for messages from BIOS/UEFI or GRUB.
2. **Use recovery mode** or **Live CD**.
3. **Check GRUB configuration**:

   ```bash
   grub> ls
   grub> set root=(hd0,1)
   grub> linux /vmlinuz... root=/dev/sdX
   grub> initrd /initrd.img
   grub> boot
   ```
4. **Chroot from Live CD**:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sdX /mnt
   chroot /mnt
   ```
5. **Reinstall GRUB**:

   ```bash
   grub-install /dev/sdX
   update-grub
   ```

---

### 4. **What are inodes in Linux?**

**Answer:**

An **inode** is a data structure used to store metadata about a file:

* File size
* Ownership (UID/GID)
* Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)
* Permissions
* Pointers to data blocks

**Inodes do not store:** File name or actual data.

To view inode:

```bash
ls -i filename
```

To find files by inode:

```bash
find / -inum <inode_number>
```

---

### 5. **How does memory management work in Linux (buffers, cache, swap)?**

**Answer:**

Linux memory is divided into:

* **Used memory** – Active processes.
* **Buffers** – Temporary storage for data about to be written to disk.
* **Cache** – Recently accessed data to speed up future access.
* **Swap** – Disk space used when RAM is full.

Check usage:

```bash
free -h
```

Example output:

```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           8.0G        2.5G        1.2G         0.5G        4.3G        4.0G
Swap:          2.0G          0G        2.0G
```

---

### 6. **How do you monitor system performance (CPU, RAM, I/O)?**

**Answer:**

* **CPU**:

  ```bash
  top
  htop
  mpstat -P ALL
  ```

* **Memory**:

  ```bash
  free -m
  vmstat 1
  ```

* **Disk I/O**:

  ```bash
  iostat -x 1
  iotop
  ```

* **Network**:

  ```bash
  iftop
  nload
  netstat or ss
  ```

---

### 7. **Explain the difference between `fork()` and `exec()` system calls.**

**Answer:**

* `fork()` creates a **new process (child)** by duplicating the parent.
* `exec()` replaces the current process image with a **new program**.

They are often used together:

```c
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    // child process
    execl("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
}
```

---

### 8. **What is SELinux and how does it work?**

**Answer:**

**SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)** is a security module that enforces **mandatory access controls (MAC)**.

* Uses **policies** to restrict users and processes beyond traditional file permissions.
* Controls access based on **contexts** (`user:role:type:level`).

**Commands:**

```bash
getenforce       # Check status (Enforcing, Permissive, Disabled)
setenforce 0     # Set to permissive
sestatus         # Detailed status
```

To manage policies:

```bash
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/web(/.*)?'
restorecon -Rv /web
```

---

### 9. **How do you secure a Linux server?**

**Answer:**

Basic steps:

1. **Update packages** regularly:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. **Use firewalls** (`ufw`, `iptables`):

   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

3. **Disable root SSH login**:

   * Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

     ```
     PermitRootLogin no
     ```

4. **Use SSH keys instead of passwords.**

5. **Install fail2ban** to prevent brute-force attacks.

6. **Use SELinux or AppArmor** for MAC.

7. **Audit logs** regularly:

   ```bash
   journalctl
   cat /var/log/auth.log
   ```

```bash
ip -4 addr show eth0 | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
```

* **Using `hostname` (shorter output):**

```bash
hostname -I
```

* **Using legacy `ifconfig` (deprecated but still used):**

```bash
ifconfig
```

> ⚠️ Note: You may need to install `net-tools` to use `ifconfig`.

---

### 2. **What’s the use of `netstat`, `ss`, and `ip` commands?**

**Answer:**

| Command   | Purpose                                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `netstat` | Shows open ports, connections, routing tables *(deprecated)*   |
| `ss`      | Modern replacement for `netstat`, faster and more detailed     |
| `ip`      | Shows and manages IP addresses, routes, and network interfaces |

**Examples:**

* `netstat -tulnp` → Show open TCP/UDP ports with programs.
* `ss -tulnp` → Faster version of the above.
* `ip a` → Show IP addresses.
* `ip r` → Show routing table.
* `ss -s` → Socket summary (TCP stats).

---

### 3. **How do you add a static route in Linux?**

**Answer:**

You can add a static route using the `ip route` command.

**Temporary route (until reboot):**

```bash
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

**To make it persistent:**

* **On Debian/Ubuntu** → Add to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```bash
up route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

* **On RHEL/CentOS** → Add to `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0`:

```
192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

---

### 4. **What is the purpose of `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`?**

**Answer:**

* **`/etc/hosts`**

  * Maps **hostnames to IP addresses** locally (bypasses DNS).
  * Useful for local testing or small static networks.

  Example:

  ```
  127.0.0.1    localhost
  192.168.1.10  webserver.local
  ```

* **`/etc/resolv.conf`**

  * Configures **DNS servers** for name resolution.

  Example:

  ```
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  nameserver 1.1.1.1
  ```

> Note: On modern systems using **systemd-resolved**, this file may be managed automatically.
