Here‚Äôs what I found regarding C++-related interview questions asked by **Akkodis**:

I couldn‚Äôt find any **publicly available listings or transcripts** specifically detailing C++ questions for Akkodis interviews online. However, here‚Äôs what I uncovered from reputable sources:

### What We Know About Akkodis Interviews

#### From AmbitionBox:

* **Software Engineer‚Äìrelated interviews** at Akkodis focus on describing projects and experiences rather than tackling deep technical problems ([AmbitionBox][1]).
* Other roles (like Backend Developer, Design Engineer) involve coding tests, panel discussions, and domain-specific topics (e.g., automotive, logic gates, etc.) ([AmbitionBox][2]).

#### From Glassdoor:

* For **Graduate Engineer Trainee**, common coding questions include **‚ÄúTwo Sum‚Äù** and **‚ÄúGroup Anagrams‚Äù** (typical LeetCode-style problems) ([static.glassdoor.fr][3]).
* No C++-specific questions were disclosed in these interviews.

**Summary**:
It seems Akkodis doesn‚Äôt typically publish C++-specific interview content in public forums. But the nature of questions they've shared suggests basic algorithmic and problem-solving assessments.

### What C++ Areas to Prepare for Interviews (General Guidance)

Even though there isn‚Äôt Akkodis-specific C++ content, here are widely relevant topics you should be familiar with‚Äîdrawn from broad community insights:

* **Core language concepts**: pointers vs. references, stack vs. heap, smart pointers, rvalue/lvalue references ([Reddit][4])
* **STL understanding**: container choices (`map` vs. `unordered_map`), complexity, algorithms, RAII principles ([Reddit][4])
* **Object-oriented design**: access specifiers, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual destructors, vtable mechanics ([Reddit][5])
* **Modern C++ features**: rule of three/five, RAII, C++11+ aspects (e.g., `unique_ptr`/`shared_ptr`) ([Reddit][6])
* **Memory & performance**: data structure efficiency, caching, memory alignment, concurrency basics ([Reddit][4])

### What to Do Next

If you‚Äôre preparing for an Akkodis position with C++ involvement, I recommend:

1. **Brush up on general C++ fundamentals**: memory management, object-oriented programming, modern C++ paradigms.
2. **Practice LeetCode-style problems**: ‚ÄúTwo Sum‚Äù, ‚ÄúGroup Anagrams‚Äù, and similar algorithmic challenges.
3. **Be ready to discuss your projects**: how you designed them, key decisions, and challenges (common in their interviews) ([AmbitionBox][1], [static.glassdoor.fr][3]).
4. **Ask your recruiter**: If possible, gently enquire about the topics or areas the technical round will focus on‚Äîit always helps to tailor your preparation.
